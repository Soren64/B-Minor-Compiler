# B-Minor-Compiler
This project is for manually creating a compiler that is able to scan, parse, construct executable code. 
The compiler is works with a subset of the C programming language called B-Minor. 

# Status / TODO 
Currently this project has the scanner and parser part of the compiler (frontend). 
The next logical step would involve creating an abstract syntax tree (AST) for syntax analysis to then be able to generate code.

# How to run
Since the compiler does not have full functionality, individual components can be tested for functionaility using the example files (.bminor extension).
Functionality can be tested using the main.c file (with more or less functionality depending on individual component(s)).

# License
None.
